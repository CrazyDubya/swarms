AI Research & Analysis Platform Demo

This demo showcases the full functionality of the Swarms framework by creating
a comprehensive research platform with multiple specialized agents working together.

Features demonstrated:
- Multiple agent types (Agent, ToolAgent, Worker)
- Sequential and concurrent workflows
- Agent specialization and collaboration
- File operations and document processing
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Interactive CLI interface
- Local and cloud LLM integration
